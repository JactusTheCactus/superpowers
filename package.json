  "description": "All super powered individuals are sorted by two stats; Their power, and the strength of that power. There are SEVEN different classifications of power one can have; Pẹtra, Ịgniſ, Þæ̣læſ, Æ̣nemóſ, Tọnit, Sọliſ, Skị́a. These powers are divided into three tiers, each rarer than the last: - Tier-2 is 100 times rarer than Tier-3 - Tier-1 is 100 times rarer than Tier-2 - Tier-1 is 10,000 times rarer than Tier-3",
